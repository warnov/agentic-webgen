## Project Overview

This application demonstrates a **multi-agent architecture** where the user interacts through a Python console app to request the creation of a business card for a given person. The user can provide full or partial data (name, profession, location, etc.), and the agents will intelligently complete the rest and generate a realistic business card.

The final output is a **web-based HTML card** hosted on Azure Blob Storage.

For example, given this input to the application:
```plain text
Please generate an online business card for Walter Novoa. A Cloud Solutions Architect from Colombia. The title should be CSA.
```
The system will generate a business card with the provided details and will publish in a public URL with a content like this:

![Sample Business Card](misc/card-csa.png)

That was a sample input, but the system is flexible enough to handle various formats and incomplete data, showcasing the power of **LLM-based agents** in understanding and processing natural language. For example:

```plain text
A recently graduated marketing girl in Africa.
```

Could produce a card like this (Observe that in this situations we won't have prescriptive results, as the agents have been given the freedom to interpret the input and generate a card based on their understanding of the context):

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure multi-agent solutions in Azure AI Foundry.
- How to connect agents through tools and chain them.
- How to invoke external services like Azure Functions and Blob Storage.
- How to separate model intelligence from system orchestration logic.

## Architecture

![Architecture](misc/agentic_webgen_arch.png)

The diagram above illustrates the complete solution architecture based on **Azure AI Foundry**, which enables generating and publishing personal business cards starting from natural language input, using a **multi-agent approach**. Each component is designed to show how agents, tools, and Azure services interact to produce the final result.

---

### Execution Flow

1. **Python Console App (Desktop Client)**  
   - The flow begins when a user enters a natural language message via a Python console application.  
   - This message can include complete or partial data about a person to build their business card.

2. **Orchestrator Agent in Azure AI Foundry**  
   - The message is sent to the **Orchestrator Agent**, which analyzes the user's intent.
   - This agent has multiple tools (**highlighted in green**), including:
     - A tool to invoke another agent (Agent-to-Agent Tool).
     - A tool to invoke an Azure Function (Azure Function Tool).

3. **Agent-to-Agent Tool ‚Üí JSON Card Generator Agent**  
   - The Orchestrator uses its **agent tool** to delegate the task of understanding the message to a second agent: the **JSON Card Generator Agent**.
   - This agent uses a **GPT-3.5 model** (**connections shown in orange**) to extract structured information and convert it into a JSON object containing the business card fields (name, title, city, etc.).

4. **Azure Function: HTML Template Filler**  
   - Once the JSON is received, the Orchestrator decides to use the **Azure Function Tool**.
   - It invokes a function deployed as an **Azure App Service using Flex Consumption**, which receives the JSON as input.

5. **Azure Storage ‚Äì Templates Container**  
   - The Azure Function downloads an HTML template (`Business Card Template.html`) from the Templates container in Azure Blob Storage.

6. **Template Replacement and Publication**  
   - Using the received information, the Azure Function dynamically fills the HTML template.
   - Then it saves a new version (`Card1.html`, `Card2.html`, etc.) in the Cards container with **public access** enabled.

7. **Response to the User**  
   - The Azure Function returns the public URL of the generated HTML file.
   - The Orchestrator receives this URL and returns it to the original client (the Python Console App), allowing the user to open their personalized card as a web page.

---

### Visual Highlights in the Diagram

- **Tools used by the Orchestrator Agent** are clearly shown in **green**, representing its orchestration capabilities and ability to delegate tasks.
- **Calls to GPT-3.5 models** are shown in **orange**, emphasizing that reasoning is powered by a language model.
- **Azure Function and Storage** are integrated as external components, accessible from agents via tools.
- **Separation of storage containers** (one for templates, one for generated cards) reflects a clean, scalable architecture.

This setup showcases a modular, extensible AI solution using LLM-based agents, multi-step orchestration, and cloud-native publishing.

## Solution Setup

This solution requires the deployment of a resource group that will contain all the core infrastructure components. Each element is configured to support the application's runtime, storage, and AI capabilities.

---

### Deploy Azure Required Components

We have included the [infra](./infra) folder from where you can deploy all the necessary Azure infrastructure components for this solution. Please check its [readme](./infra/README.md).

The infrastructure includes:

- **A Resource Group**  
  A logical container to host all resources related to the solution. All deployments will target this group to ensure scoped management, billing, and lifecycle control.

- **Storage Account**  
  A central storage layer that supports both internal operations and public content exposure. The configuration includes:
  - **SKU**: `Standard_LRS`
  - **Kind**: `StorageV2`
  - **Access Tier**: `Hot`
  - **HTTPS Traffic Only**: Enabled
  
  Two blob containers will be created:
  - `templates`: private access; used to store internal templates.
  - `cards`: public (blob-level) access; intended for publish the generated card assets.

- **Azure Function App**  
  The compute component of the solution, responsible for executing backend logic. It is deployed with the following configuration:
  - **Plan**: Elastic Premium (EP1) on Linux (`elastic` kind with `ElasticPremium` tier)
  - **Runtime**: .NET 8 Isolated Worker (`DOTNET-ISOLATED|8.0`)  
  - **HTTPS Only**: Enabled
  - **App Settings**:
    (Besides the default ones)
    - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: Storage connection for custom operations set to the connection string of the created storage account

- **Azure AI Foundry (Cognitive Services)**  
  The AI orchestration platform that enables multi-agent workflows. It is deployed as a Cognitive Services resource with the following configuration:
  - **Resource Type**: `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts`
  - **Kind**: `AIServices` (multi-service AI resource, **NOT** Azure Machine Learning AI Foundry Hub a it doesn't have Agents in GA yet)
  - **SKU**: `S0` (Standard pricing tier)
  - **Identity**: System-assigned managed identity enabled
  - **Network Access**: Public network access enabled with custom subdomain
  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All resources should be deployed in the same Azure region to ensure compatibility, performance, and cost efficiency.

---

### Configure Deployed Services
At this point it is supposed that either using the provided ARM template or manually, you have deployed the necessary Azure resources. Now, you should have the [required components](#required-components) ready. With these components in place, you can proceed to configure the services as follows:

#### Azure Storage
Two storage containers were deployed:
- **`templates`**: Contains the HTML template for business cards, which is private and not publicly accessible. A sample template file called [`business_card_template.html`](./misc/business_card_template.html) is provided in the `misc` folder. You can upload it to the `templates` container using Azure Storage Explorer, the Azure Portal or this command (for this you need to have the Azure CLI installed, configured and authenticated):
 
```bash
az storage blob upload --account-name stagenticwebgenw --container-name templates --file ./misc/business_card_template.html --name business_card_template.html
```
That is the template that will be used by the Azure Function to generate the business cards.

- **`cards`**: Publicly accessible container where generated business cards will be stored by the Azure Function. The cards will be accessible via public URLs. No required action at this point.

#### Azure Function
The Azure Function App is already configured to use the storage account created in the infrastructure deployment. You can verify this in the Azure Portal under the Function App's **Configuration** settings.
We just need to upload the code for the Azure Function that will generate the business cards. You can do this by using any of the methods described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies?tabs=windows#deployment-methods). 

#### Azure AI Foundry
We need to create an AI Foundry project within the Azure AI Foundry resource. This project will contain the agents, models, and tools necessary for the solution. You can do this by following these steps:
1. Go to the Azure AI Foundry resource in the Azure Portal.
2. Click on **Agents** in the left menu: This will take you to the AI Foundry project creation page.
3. Write a name for the project, e.g., `agentic-webgen-project`, and click **Create**.
4. When the project is created, you will be able to create a **deployment**. In Azure AI Foundry, a deployment refers to the disposition of a language model to be used by your agents. In the bottom o the left menu select **Models + endpoints** and then in the right pane clic on **+Deploy model**. You can create one or many deployments with different models, but for this solution we will use only one deployment of the `gpt-35-turbo` model (a very economic model for this test), so choose **Deploy base model** and search for it. Select it, leave the default values and click **Deploy**.
5. Now let's get the Azure AI Foundry project endpoint so we could reference it in the Python client to manage the agents here. So from the left menu choose Overview and copy the **Endpoint** URL. It should look like this: `https://<your-foundry-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project-name>`. You will need this URL to configure the Python client.

With this, you are ready to run the solution. The Python client will use this endpoint to interact with the AI Foundry project and manage the agents! ü§ñ

### Setting Up the Environment
To run the solution, you need to set up the environment variables and install the required dependencies.
#### Azure Function (FxTemplateFiller - C#)
To test your function locally, you will need a `local.settings.json` file in the `AgenticWebGen.DotNetTools/AgenticWebGen.DotNetTools.Fx` folder. You can use the provided `local.settings.json.txt` as a template and rename it to `local.settings.json`. Make sure to set the `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` to the connection string of the storage account you created in the infrastructure deployment.
With this, you could run the Azure Function locally for example using the Azure Functions Core Tools (or Visual Studio if you have it installed). You can do this by running the following command in the `AgenticWebGen.DotNetTools/AgenticWebGen.DotNetTools.Fx` folder:

```bash
func start
```
Then, if you installed the recommended rest client extension for VSCode, you can test the Azure Function using the provided `requests/http/FxTemplateFiller.http` file by clicking `Send Request`. (You could use other tools such as Postman, Curl, etc.)

It should give you a response with the URL of the generated business card HTML file, which you can then open in your browser to see the result:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 30 Jul 2025 21:07:05 GMT
Server: Kestrel
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
  "url": "https://yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/cards/filled_template_20250730210706.html"
}
```
#### Agents Application (Python Console App)
Create a `.env` file in the `agent-webmaster-py/` folder based on the provided `.env.txt` template. Be sure to set the `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, the `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`, and the `AZURE_FUNCTION_URL` to the values of your Azure AI Foundry project endpoint, the storage account connection string, and the Azure Function URL (with its code) respectively.

Now, we need to install the required Python dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in the `agent-webmaster-py/` folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Card Generator Agent Testing
As it was explained, we have two agents: the **JSON Card Generator Agent** and the **Orchestrator Agent**. The first one is used to extract structured data from natural language input, while the second one is used to orchestrate the workflow and call the Azure Function to generate the business card HTML file. So, being the first one the simplest, you can test it by running the following command in the `agent-webmaster-py/agents/ag_card_generator/` folder:

```bash
python ag_card_generator_tester.py
```

An interactive console will prompt you to enter a natural language message, such as "Create a business card for John Doe, a software engineer from Seattle." The agent will process this input and return the structured JSON data it extracted. In the future, this JSON is the one used by the Orchestrator Agent to send it to the Azure Function and generate the business card HTML file.

##### Orchestrator Agent Testing
Once you have tested the JSON Card Generator Agent, you can test the Orchestrator Agent.

This will complete the testing of our whole solution, as the Orchestrator Agent will receive the prompt from the user, call the JSON Card Generator Agent to extract the structured data, and then invoke the Azure Function to generate the business card HTML file whos URL will be returned to the user for them to open it in their browser and see the result.
Just run the following command in the `agent-webmaster-py/agents/ag_web_gen/` folder:

```bash
python ag_web_gen_tester.py
```

This will start an interactive console where you can enter natural language messages to generate business cards with an experience similar to this:
